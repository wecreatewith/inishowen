Inishowen offers accommodation to suit all tastes and budgets, from traditional Irish B&Bs with legendary hospitality to modern hotels, rustic cottages, and wild camping spots. The key decision is where to base yourself — the peninsula is larger than many visitors expect, and your choice of location affects what you can easily explore.

## Where to Base Yourself

The best location depends on your priorities and how long you're staying.

### Buncrana

**Best for:** First-time visitors, families, those wanting amenities

Buncrana is the largest town on the peninsula and the most practical base for many visitors. You'll find:
- The widest choice of hotels, B&Bs, and restaurants
- Supermarkets, pharmacies, and shops
- ATMs and services
- Central location for exploring both north and south
- Pleasant waterfront and beach

**Drawbacks:** It's a working town rather than a picturesque village. Less atmospheric than smaller settlements.

**Driving times:** 15 min to Fort Dunree, 40 min to Malin Head, 35 min to Greencastle

---

### Ballyliffin

**Best for:** Golfers, beach lovers, couples seeking a quieter base

A small village that has grown thanks to its championship golf courses and proximity to Pollan Bay beach. Ballyliffin offers:
- Several good hotels and guest houses
- Excellent dining options for its size
- Quieter atmosphere than Buncrana
- Close to northern beaches and Doagh Famine Village
- Good base for Malin Head

**Drawbacks:** Limited shops and services. Restaurants can book up in high season.

**Driving times:** 20 min to Malin Head, 25 min to Buncrana, 30 min to Greencastle

---

### Malin / Malin Head Area

**Best for:** Northern lights seekers, photographers, those wanting remoteness

The northernmost settlements on the peninsula. Staying here puts you closest to [Malin Head](/malin-head/) and the dramatic northern coastline. Options include:
- Traditional B&Bs with genuine Irish hospitality
- A few self-catering cottages
- Proximity to Five Finger Strand and Culdaff Beach
- Best location for northern lights viewing
- Authentic "end of the road" atmosphere

**Drawbacks:** Very limited services. You'll need a car for everything. Restaurants are few.

**Driving times:** 10 min to Malin Head, 35 min to Buncrana, 25 min to Culdaff

---

### Greencastle / Moville (Eastern Shore)

**Best for:** Seafood lovers, those arriving via Northern Ireland, quieter atmosphere

The eastern shore of the peninsula, overlooking Lough Foyle towards Northern Ireland. This area offers:
- Working fishing harbour (Greencastle) with excellent seafood
- Victorian seaside charm (Moville)
- Easier access from Derry/Belfast
- Foyle Ferry connection to Northern Ireland
- Inishowen Maritime Museum
- Generally quieter than the western shore

**Drawbacks:** Further from Malin Head and the main Atlantic beaches.

**Driving times:** 45 min to Malin Head, 35 min to Buncrana, 30 min to Derry

---

### Carndonagh

**Best for:** Central location, traditional market town atmosphere

The main commercial centre of the peninsula, Carndonagh ("Carn" locally) sits roughly in the middle:
- Practical base for exploring all areas
- Traditional Irish town rather than tourist resort
- Good range of shops and services
- Home to the ancient Donagh Cross (7th century)

**Drawbacks:** Less scenic than coastal locations. Few tourism-focused facilities.

**Driving times:** 25 min to Malin Head, 25 min to Buncrana, 30 min to Greencastle

**Shoulder season (April-May, September-October):** Book **2-4 weeks ahead**. Good availability but popular places still book up.

**Winter (November-March):** Often possible to book **days ahead** or on arrival, but check that places are open — some B&Bs close seasonally.

### Booking Platforms

**Hotels:** Booking.com, Hotels.com, direct booking
**B&Bs:** Booking.com, direct contact (many aren't listed online)
**Self-catering:** Airbnb, VRBO, local agencies
**Camping:** Often no booking required; check individual sites

## Practical Considerations

### Getting Around

**A car is essential** for exploring Inishowen. Public transport is minimal, and attractions are spread across the peninsula. Most accommodation can arrange parking.

**From your base to key attractions:**
- Factor in 20-45 minutes driving to most sights
- Don't underestimate distances — roads are scenic but winding
- Consider staying in different areas on multi-day trips

### WiFi and Mobile Signal

- Most hotels and B&Bs offer WiFi
- Mobile signal varies — good in towns, patchy in rural areas (especially around Malin Head)
- If you need reliable connectivity for work, check with accommodation before booking

### Accessibility

Many older B&Bs and traditional cottages have limited accessibility features (stairs, narrow doorways). If you have mobility requirements:
- Contact accommodation directly to discuss needs
- Newer hotels generally have accessible rooms
- Some modern self-catering properties are purpose-built for accessibility
