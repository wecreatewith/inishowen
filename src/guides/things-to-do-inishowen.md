The Inishowen Peninsula packs an extraordinary variety of attractions into Ireland's most northerly corner. From a 3,000-year-old hilltop fort with views across five counties to the dramatic cliffs of [Malin Head](/malin-head/), there's enough here to fill a week — or a lifetime of return visits.

This guide covers the peninsula's top attractions and activities, from must-see landmarks to hidden gems that locals love.

## Top Attractions

### Grianán of Aileach

**The unmissable landmark** — this magnificent stone fort crowns a hilltop near Burt, commanding views across Lough Swilly, Lough Foyle, and on clear days, five counties. Built around **1700 BC** and restored in the 1870s, Grianán of Aileach (pronounced "green-awn of ale-ach") was the royal seat of the O'Neill dynasty, High Kings of Ulster.

The circular stone walls rise to 5 metres high and 4 metres thick, with three internal terraces connected by stairways. Standing inside the fort, looking out through the ancient doorway across the landscape below, is one of Ireland's most atmospheric experiences.

**Location:** Burt, at the base of the peninsula
**Admission:** Free (heritage site)
**Facilities:** Car park, information panels
**Time needed:** 30-60 minutes

**Tip:** Visit at sunset for spectacular light across Lough Swilly. The short walk from the car park takes about 5 minutes uphill.

### Fort Dunree Military Museum

Perched on the cliffs above Lough Swilly, Fort Dunree offers a fascinating window into Ireland's military history combined with stunning coastal scenery. The fort was built in 1798 to defend against French invasion and later became a key British naval installation.

The **museum** houses extensive collections covering the fort's history from Napoleonic times through both World Wars to Irish independence. Original guns, military equipment, and detailed exhibits bring the stories to life.

Beyond the museum, the **headland walks** are exceptional. The cliff paths offer dramatic views of Lough Swilly and, on clear days, across to the Fanad Peninsula. Several looped walking trails of varying lengths start from the fort.

**Location:** Dunree Head, 8km north of Buncrana
**Opening:** Daily, seasonal hours (check website)
**Admission:** Adults €7, children €3, families €15
**Facilities:** Café, toilets, shop, walking trails
**Time needed:** 2-3 hours (museum + walks)

### Doagh Famine Village

This unique **outdoor museum** tells the story of Irish life from the Great Famine (1845-1852) to the present day. Unlike traditional museums, Doagh presents its history through a recreated village of cottages, each depicting a different era or theme.

Walking through the village, you'll encounter scenes from famine times, the wake house tradition, a traditional schoolroom, and exhibits on more recent history including the Troubles. Local guides provide context and stories that bring the displays to life.

What sets Doagh apart is its willingness to tackle difficult subjects — poverty, emigration, conflict — with honesty and even dark humour. It's moving, informative, and genuinely memorable.

**Location:** Lagacurry, near Ballyliffin
**Opening:** Daily March-November
**Admission:** Adults €10, children €6
**Facilities:** Café, gift shop, parking
**Time needed:** 1.5-2 hours

**Tip:** Allow time for the café afterwards — the scones are excellent and the views across to Pollan Bay are lovely.

---

### Wild Ireland

A **wildlife sanctuary** set across 23 acres of ancient woodland near Burnfoot. Wild Ireland provides homes for rescued animals including brown bears, wolves, lynx, wild boar, and various bird species — animals that once roamed wild in Ireland.

The sanctuary operates on a conservation and education mission, with elevated walkways and viewing platforms allowing visitors to observe the animals in naturalistic enclosures. The brown bears are particularly impressive, having been rescued from poor conditions in Eastern Europe.

**Location:** Burnfoot, southern Inishowen
**Opening:** Daily, seasonal hours
**Admission:** Adults €16, children €12, families €50
**Facilities:** Café, gift shop, accessible paths
**Time needed:** 2-3 hours

**Best for:** Families, wildlife enthusiasts, photographers

### Glenevin Waterfall

A beautiful 12-metre waterfall hidden in a wooded glen near Clonmany. The walk to the waterfall follows the Glenevin River through native woodland — a peaceful escape from the more exposed coastal landscapes.

The **walking trail** is approximately 1km each way and takes about 30-40 minutes return. The path is well-maintained with bridges and steps, though it can be muddy after rain. The waterfall is most impressive after wet weather when the water flow is at its peak.

**Location:** 3km from Clonmany village
**Admission:** Free
**Facilities:** Car park (€2 honesty box), basic
**Time needed:** 1 hour

**Tip:** Combine with a visit to nearby Tullagh Bay beach for a contrasting coastal experience.

### Inishowen Maritime Museum & Planetarium

Located in the historic Coastguard Station at Greencastle, this museum tells the story of Inishowen's deep connection to the sea. Exhibits cover fishing heritage, shipwrecks (including the Spanish Armada), lighthouses, and maritime rescue.

The **planetarium** offers shows about the night sky, constellations, and space exploration — particularly relevant given Inishowen's status as a dark sky area ideal for stargazing and northern lights viewing.

**Location:** Greencastle harbour
**Opening:** Seasonal (April-September typically)
**Admission:** Museum €5, Planetarium shows €8
**Facilities:** Gift shop, nearby cafés
**Time needed:** 1-2 hours
