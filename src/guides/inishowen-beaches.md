The Inishowen Peninsula is blessed with some of Ireland's most beautiful and unspoilt beaches. Stretching between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle, this rugged coastline offers everything from wild Atlantic surf spots to sheltered family-friendly bays.

Several Inishowen beaches hold **Blue Flag** status for water quality and facilities, while others are **Wild Atlantic Way Discovery Points** — officially recognised for their outstanding natural beauty. Whether you're looking for swimming, surfing, walking, or simply stunning scenery, there's a beach here for you.

## The Best Beaches in Inishowen

### Five Finger Strand

**The headline attraction** — Five Finger Strand is home to what are believed to be the **highest sand dunes in Europe**, towering over 30 metres above the beach. These remarkable dunes are around 5,000 years old, held together by tough marram grass that thrives as wind blows sand onto it.

The beach takes its name from the dramatic **sea stacks** on its northern side, which rise from the water like giant fingers. The contrast of golden sand, turquoise water, and these rocky formations makes this one of Ireland's most photographed beaches.

**Location:** 6km north of Malin village
**Best for:** Walking, photography, birdwatching
**Swimming:** Not recommended due to strong currents
**Facilities:** Limited — bring supplies

**Tip:** The best views are from the **Knockamany Bends** viewpoint above the beach. Stop here first for photos before descending to the strand.

**Nearby:** Wild Alpaca Way offers walks with alpacas overlooking the beach. St. Mary's Church (1784), one of Ireland's oldest Catholic churches still in use, sits just behind the dunes.

### Culdaff Beach

**Blue Flag** | **Wild Atlantic Way Discovery Point**

Culdaff is often called the **best family beach in Inishowen** — and it's easy to see why. This long sandy stretch on the northeast coast offers shallow waters, soft white sand, and plenty of space for children to play safely.

The beach actually comprises two sections — **Big Beach** and **Small Beach** — separated by the headlands of Black Rock and Lady's Rock. Both look northeast towards the Scottish islands on clear days.

**Location:** Culdaff village, northeast Inishowen
**Best for:** Families, swimming, picnics
**Swimming:** Excellent — sheltered, shallow waters
**Facilities:** Toilets, picnic areas, nearby village amenities
**Lifeguards:** Seasonal (summer months)

**Nearby beaches:** Five Finger Strand (15 min), Kinnagoe Bay (20 min), Pollan Bay (20 min)

### Pollan Bay (Ballyliffin)

**Wild Atlantic Way Discovery Point**

Just outside Ballyliffin village, Pollan Bay is a golden strand with spectacular views of [Malin Head](/malin-head/) and Glashedy Island. The beach catches good Atlantic swells, making it one of the **best surf spots in Donegal**.

The setting is dramatic — on a clear day, you can see Ireland's most northerly point from the sand. The beach faces west, making it ideal for sunset watching.

**Location:** Adjacent to Ballyliffin village
**Best for:** Surfing, walking, sunset views
**Swimming:** Good, but check conditions — can have currents
**Facilities:** The Coffee Barn in the car park serves hot drinks and snacks

**Tip:** Ballyliffin is home to two championship golf courses if you want to combine beach time with a round.

### Stroove Beach

**Blue Flag** | **Wild Atlantic Way Discovery Point**

Stroove (also spelled Shroove) sits at the far eastern tip of the peninsula, sheltered from prevailing Atlantic winds and overlooked by a **lighthouse built in 1837**. Known locally as "Big White Bay," this compact beach — around 100 metres long — is a popular swimming spot.

The sheltered aspect means calmer waters than the west-facing beaches, making it excellent for swimming and families.

**Location:** Eastern tip of Inishowen, near Greencastle
**Best for:** Swimming, walking, lighthouse views
**Swimming:** Excellent — sheltered and lifeguard protected in summer
**Facilities:** Good — toilets, parking
**Lifeguards:** Daily from late June to late August

**Walking:** The **Inishowen Head Loop** starts from Stroove car park — an 8.3km trail taking 2-3 hours through stunning coastal scenery.

---

### Kinnagoe Bay

**Wild Atlantic Way Discovery Point**

A hidden gem that many consider their favourite Donegal beach. This secluded bay is beautifully rugged, exposed to Atlantic waves, and steeped in history.

At high tide, the strand splits into two sections divided by a rocky headland. The beach is the **final resting place of La Trinidad Valencera**, a Spanish Armada ship that ran aground here in 1588. A small plaque commemorates the wreck.

**Location:** Northeast coast, between Culdaff and Greencastle
**Best for:** Scenery, history, photography
**Swimming:** Check conditions — exposed to Atlantic swells
**Facilities:** Limited

---

### Tullagh Bay

A beautiful **horseshoe-shaped beach** just 3km northwest of Clonmany village. Tullagh Bay offers a more secluded feel than some of the busier strands, with dramatic cliffs framing the golden sand.

**Location:** 3km from Clonmany
**Best for:** Walking, escaping crowds
**Swimming:** Good in calm conditions

---

### Lisfannon Beach

On the Lough Swilly side of the peninsula, Lisfannon is a long sandy beach popular with families from Buncrana and the surrounding area. The gentle slope and calm waters make it suitable for children.

**Location:** Between Buncrana and Fahan
**Best for:** Families, watersports
**Swimming:** Good — gentler waters than Atlantic-facing beaches

---

### Kinnego Bay

A small, secluded cove on Inch Island (connected to the mainland by causeway). Kinnego Bay offers calm waters and fine views across Lough Swilly to Rathmullan.

**Location:** Inch Island, off the main peninsula
**Best for:** Quiet escapes, calm swimming

## Beach Safety
