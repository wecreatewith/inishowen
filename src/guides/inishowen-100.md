The **Inishowen 100** is a signposted 100km scenic driving route that loops around the entire Inishowen Peninsula, Ireland's largest and most northerly peninsula. The route showcases some of Ireland's most dramatic coastal scenery, from the 3,000-year-old hilltop fort of Grianán of Aileach to the wild headlands of [Malin Head](/malin-head/).

Part of the **Wild Atlantic Way** — Europe's longest defined coastal route — the Inishowen 100 offers a concentrated taste of what makes Ireland's Atlantic coast so special. You can drive it in a day, but two or three days allows proper exploration.

## The Route Overview

The Inishowen 100 forms a rough figure-of-eight around the peninsula, with Lough Swilly to the west and Lough Foyle to the east. The route is **waymarked with brown signs** featuring the distinctive Inishowen 100 logo.

**Starting point:** Most visitors begin at Bridgend (junction of N13 and R238), though you can join the loop anywhere.

**Direction:** The route can be driven in either direction. This guide follows a **clockwise** route, starting at Bridgend and heading west along Lough Swilly first. This approach saves [Malin Head](/malin-head/) — the headline attraction — for a dramatic mid-route highlight.

**Total distance:** Approximately 100km
**Minimum driving time:** 3-4 hours (without stops)
**Recommended time:** 1-3 days

## The Route in Detail

### Section 1: Bridgend to Buncrana (Western Shore)

**Distance:** 25km | **Driving time:** 30 minutes

The route begins at **Bridgend**, where the R238 branches off towards Inishowen. Your first major stop is just a few miles in:

#### Grianán of Aileach

The route passes directly beneath this magnificent **Stone Age fort** perched on a hilltop at Burt. Dating to around 1700 BC and restored in the 1870s, Grianán of Aileach (pronounced "green-awn of ale-ach") was the royal seat of the O'Neill dynasty.

The circular stone walls rise 5 metres high, with views across Lough Swilly, Lough Foyle, and five counties on clear days. It's one of Ireland's most impressive ancient monuments.

**Stop time:** 30-60 minutes
**Tip:** The short walk from the car park is uphill — allow 5 minutes each way.

Continuing north along the western shore of Lough Swilly, you pass through **Fahan** (with its ancient cross slab at Fahan Mura) before reaching:

#### Buncrana

The largest town on the peninsula, Buncrana makes a natural first stop for refreshments. The waterfront is pleasant for a stroll, and **Swan Park** offers a peaceful walk along the River Crana.

**Don't miss:** Buncrana Castle ruins and the views across Lough Swilly to the Fanad Peninsula.

---

### Section 2: Buncrana to Malin (Northern Coast)

**Distance:** 40km | **Driving time:** 50 minutes

This section climbs away from Lough Swilly and crosses the peninsula's rugged interior before descending to the dramatic northern coast.

#### Fort Dunree

Shortly after Buncrana, a signed detour leads to **Fort Dunree**, a Napoleonic-era military installation perched on dramatic cliffs. The museum covers 200 years of military history, and the headland walks offer exceptional views.

**Stop time:** 1-2 hours (museum and walks)
**Note:** This is a worthwhile detour of about 8km each way.

#### The Gap of Mamore

Returning to the main route, the road climbs through the **Gap of Mamore** — a dramatic mountain pass between Mamore Hill and the Urris Hills. At 240 metres, this is the route's highest point, with sweeping views in both directions.

**Stop time:** 10-15 minutes (viewpoint)

The road then descends towards the northern coast, passing through **Clonmany** — a good stop for lunch — before continuing to:

#### Ballyliffin

A small village that punches above its weight thanks to **Ballyliffin Golf Club** (host of the Irish Open) and nearby **Pollan Bay**, one of the peninsula's best [beaches](/inishowen-beaches/). The beach catches consistent Atlantic swells and is popular with surfers.

**Nearby:** Doagh Famine Village, an outdoor museum telling the story of Irish life from the Famine to present day.

#### Malin Village

A picturesque village with what's claimed to be **Ireland's largest village green** — a triangular space lined with neat cottages. Malin makes a good base for exploring the northern headlands.

---

### Section 3: Malin Head

**Distance from Malin village:** 10km | **Driving time:** 15 minutes

The route's undisputed highlight, [Malin Head](/malin-head/) is Ireland's most northerly point and a **Wild Atlantic Way Signature Discovery Point**. Standing at Banba's Crown, you're at the very top of Ireland.

#### What to See

- **Banba's Crown** — The summit, named after a Celtic goddess
- **The Tower** — 1805 Napoleonic signal station
- **EIRE 80 Sign** — WWII navigational marker spelled in white stones
- **Hell's Hole** — Dramatic sea chasm
- **Star Wars locations** — Filming spots from *The Last Jedi*

The **Malin Head walking trail** (2.5km loop, 1 hour) connects the main viewpoints. Sturdy shoes are recommended.

**Stop time:** 1-2 hours minimum
**Facilities:** Car parks, toilets, Caffe Banba (seasonal café)

**See our full guide:** [Malin Head](/malin-head/)

### Section 4: Malin Head to Greencastle (Eastern Shore)

**Distance:** 35km | **Driving time:** 45 minutes

From Malin Head, the route descends along the peninsula's eastern coast, with views across to Scotland on clear days.

#### Five Finger Strand

A short detour leads to this remarkable beach, home to what are believed to be **Europe's highest sand dunes** — towering over 30 metres above the strand. The beach takes its name from dramatic sea stacks that rise like giant fingers from the water.

**Note:** Swimming is not recommended due to strong currents, but the beach is stunning for walking and photography.

**Stop time:** 30-60 minutes

#### Culdaff

Home to one of Inishowen's best family [beaches](/inishowen-beaches/) — **Blue Flag** rated with excellent facilities and seasonal lifeguards. The village has pubs and cafés for refreshments.

**Nearby:** Kinnagoe Bay, a secluded cove and the final resting place of La Trinidad Valencera, a Spanish Armada ship that ran aground in 1588.

#### Greencastle

A working fishing harbour known for excellent seafood. The ruined 14th-century **Greencastle Castle** gives the town its name. From here, the **Foyle Ferry** crosses to Magilligan Point in Northern Ireland (seasonal).

**Don't miss:** Kealy's Seafood Bar and the Inishowen Maritime Museum & Planetarium.

**Stop time:** 1-2 hours

---

### Section 5: Greencastle to Moville (Lough Foyle Shore)

**Distance:** 15km | **Driving time:** 20 minutes

The final section follows the calm eastern shore of Lough Foyle back towards the starting point.

#### Stroove Beach

Shortly after Greencastle, a detour leads to **Stroove Beach** — a **Blue Flag** beach overlooked by an 1837 lighthouse. The **Inishowen Head walking loop** (8.3km, 2-3 hours) starts from here.

#### Moville

A Victorian seaside town with a pleasant waterfront promenade and good restaurants. Moville developed as a resort town in the 19th century and retains that relaxed character.

**Stop time:** 30-60 minutes

From Moville, the route continues south through **Muff** and back to Bridgend, completing the loop.

## How Long Do You Need?

### One Day (Full Day, 8-10 hours)

Possible but rushed. You'll see the highlights but won't linger anywhere. Best for visitors with limited time who want to "tick off" Malin Head and the main stops.

**Suggested approach:** Start early, prioritise Grianán of Aileach, Malin Head, and 1-2 beaches. Have lunch in Ballyliffin or Greencastle.

### Two Days (Recommended)

A comfortable pace allowing proper exploration of the main attractions. Stay overnight in Buncrana, Ballyliffin, or Greencastle.

**Day 1:** Bridgend → Buncrana → Fort Dunree → Gap of Mamore → Ballyliffin → Malin
**Day 2:** Malin Head → Five Finger Strand → Culdaff → Greencastle → Moville → Bridgend

### Three Days (Ideal)

Time to explore thoroughly, including walks, museums, and quieter spots. Add detours to beaches, Glenevin Waterfall, or Wild Ireland wildlife sanctuary.

## Practical Information

### When to Drive

**Best months:** May to September offer the longest days and best weather. July and August are busiest.

**Shoulder seasons:** April and October can be excellent — fewer visitors, dramatic skies, and reasonable weather.

**Winter:** The route is open year-round, but some facilities (cafés, seasonal attractions) close November-March. Daylight hours are short.

### Road Conditions

The Inishowen 100 uses a mix of regional roads:
- **Main roads (R238, R240):** Good condition, two-lane
- **Minor roads:** Narrower, with occasional passing places
- **Mountain sections:** Gap of Mamore has hairpin bends

**Driving tips:**
- Roads are generally good but narrow in places
- Watch for sheep, especially in mountain sections
- Allow extra time for slow-moving agricultural vehicles
- Pull in at passing places to let faster traffic pass

### Fuel Stations

Fill up before starting — fuel stations are found in:
- Bridgend
- Buncrana
- Carndonagh
- Moville

There are **no fuel stations** between Carndonagh and Greencastle (the northern loop via Malin Head).

### Mobile Signal

Coverage is generally good in towns but patchy in rural areas, especially around Malin Head and the northern headlands. Download offline maps before setting out.

## Tips for Driving the Inishowen 100

### 1. Start Early

The main car parks (especially Malin Head) can fill up on busy summer days. Starting early also gives you the best light for photography.

### 2. Check the Weather

Atlantic weather can change quickly. Pack layers and waterproofs even in summer. Check forecasts at [Met Éireann](https://www.met.ie/).

### 3. Don't Rush

The distances seem short on paper but narrow roads, stunning viewpoints, and unexpected discoveries mean progress is slower than you'd expect. Build in buffer time.

### 4. Book Accommodation in Advance

In peak season (June-August), [accommodation](/inishowen-accommodation/) books up quickly, especially in Ballyliffin and around Malin. Reserve ahead.

### 5. Bring Cash

Some smaller attractions, car parks, and rural establishments are cash-only.

### 6. Check Tide Times

Beach experiences vary dramatically with the tide. Check times if you're planning walks at Five Finger Strand or Culdaff.

### 7. Consider the Foyle Ferry

The Foyle Ferry between Greencastle and Magilligan Point (Northern Ireland) can create interesting loop options if you're combining Inishowen with the Causeway Coast. Runs seasonally.

## Combining with Other Routes

### Wild Atlantic Way

The Inishowen 100 is officially part of the **Wild Atlantic Way**. Continue south to explore Fanad Peninsula, Horn Head, and the rest of Donegal's stunning coastline.

### Causeway Coastal Route

Take the Foyle Ferry from Greencastle to Magilligan, then drive the **Causeway Coastal Route** to the Giant's Causeway, Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge, and Belfast.

### Derry

The historic walled city of Derry is just 30 minutes from Bridgend. Its city walls, museums, and vibrant food scene make it worth a day trip.

## Frequently Asked Questions
