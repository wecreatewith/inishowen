    <p>
      Inishowen (Irish: <em>Inis Eoghain</em>, meaning "Owen's Island") has been inhabited for thousands of years. The peninsula is dotted with ancient monuments including the magnificent Grianán of Aileach, a stone ring fort dating back to 1700BC that offers panoramic views across both loughs.

      The peninsula is part of the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's spectacular coastal driving route. The Inishowen 100 follows the coastline for 100km, passing through dramatic scenery, traditional villages, and some of Ireland's finest beaches.
