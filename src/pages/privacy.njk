    <p>
      This privacy policy explains how Inishowen Peninsula (inishowenpeninsula.com) collects, uses, and protects your information when you visit our website.
    </p>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>

    <p>
      Inishowen Peninsula is a tourism and community information site operated by <strong>We Create With Ltd</strong>, a company registered in Ireland.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:hello@inishowenpeninsula.com">hello@inishowenpeninsula.com</a>
    </p>

    <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Data We Don't Collect</h3>

    <p>
      We don't require you to create an account, sign in, or provide any personal information to use this site. We don't:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Collect your name, email, or contact details (unless you email us)</li>
      <li>Track you across other websites</li>
      <li>Sell or share your data with third parties for marketing</li>
      <li>Use advertising networks that profile visitors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Server Logs</h3>

    <p>
      Like most websites, our hosting provider (Cloudflare) automatically collects standard server log information when you visit. This may include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your IP address</li>
      <li>Browser type and version</li>
      <li>Pages you visit and when</li>
      <li>Referring website (if any)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This data is used for security and to understand general traffic patterns. We don't have direct access to individual visitor logs.
    </p>

    <h3>Analytics</h3>

    <p>
      We may use Cloudflare Web Analytics, a privacy-first analytics service that:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Does not use cookies</li>
      <li>Does not track individual users</li>
      <li>Does not collect personal information</li>
      <li>Only shows aggregate page view data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cookies and Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>
      We minimise third-party services and only ask for consent where legally required.
    </p>

    <h3>No Consent Required</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fonts:</strong> We self-host our fonts locally. No data is sent to third parties.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We may use Cloudflare Web Analytics, which doesn't use cookies or collect personal information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Requires Consent - Facebook Embeds</h3>

    <p>
      Some articles include embedded Facebook posts from local community pages. When you first visit, you'll see a banner asking if you want to allow these embeds.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you allow embeds:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Facebook SDK will load</li>
      <li>Facebook may set cookies and track your activity</li>
      <li>You'll see embedded posts directly on our pages</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you decline, Facebook embeds won't load. The rest of the site works normally.
    </p>

    <h3>Changing Your Preference</h3>

    <p>
      You can change your preference at any time by clicking "Cookie Settings" in the footer.
    </p>
