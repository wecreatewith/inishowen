For 90 years, the distinctive narrow-gauge trains of the **Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway** wound their way through the Inishowen Peninsula, connecting Derry to Buncrana and beyond. Today, the railway is gone, but its legacy lives on — not least at **Fahan Station**, where you can still dine in the original Victorian station buildings.

## The Railway That Opened Up Inishowen

The Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company operated from **1863 to 1953**, running 99 miles of 3-foot narrow-gauge track at its peak. The first section opened on 31st December 1863, running from Derry to Farland Point on the shores of Lough Swilly.

The railway transformed Inishowen. Before the trains came, the peninsula was remote and difficult to reach. Suddenly, Derry workers could travel to Buncrana for day trips, goods could move efficiently, and the towns along the line flourished.

### The Buncrana Branch

The Derry to Buncrana line became the railway's busiest route, carrying workers, holidaymakers, and freight through the villages of Fahan, Inch Road, and Burnfoot. On summer weekends, excursion trains packed with families heading for Buncrana's beaches would snake along the shores of Lough Swilly.

Fahan was a key stop on this route, with a junction leading to Fahan Pier where passengers could connect with steamboat services across the lough to Rathmullan.

## The End of the Line

The Lough Swilly Railway closed on **8th August 1953**, unable to compete with the growing popularity of motor buses and private cars. The last train ran to little fanfare — the end of an era for Inishowen's communities.

### The Owencarrow Viaduct Disaster

The railway's most tragic moment came on 30th January 1925, when a train crossing the Owencarrow Viaduct was struck by winds of up to 120mph. Four people lost their lives in the disaster. The viaduct, near Creeslough, remained in use until the railway's closure but serves as a reminder of the extreme conditions these mountain railways faced.

## Fahan Station Today: The Railway Tavern

While most of the Lough Swilly Railway has vanished beneath roads and fields, **Fahan Station** survives as one of the best-preserved remnants of this lost railway.

The original Victorian stone station building now houses the **Railway Tavern and Firebox Grill** — and it's not just the building that's authentic. The restaurant's centrepiece is a genuine **steam locomotive firebox**, converted into an open grill where steaks are cooked over the coals.

The Railway Tavern has won multiple awards, including Ireland's Steakhouse of the Year in 2023. The interior is filled with railway memorabilia, old photographs, and original architectural features. On certain evenings, traditional music sessions add to the atmosphere.

**Visiting the Railway Tavern:**
- **Address:** Fahan, Co. Donegal
- **Website:** [railwaytavern.com](https://www.railwaytavern.com/)
- **Booking:** Recommended, especially for the Firebox Grill

## What Remains of the Railway

Beyond Fahan Station, traces of the Lough Swilly Railway can still be found across Inishowen:

- **Buncrana Station** — the old station building survives in the town
- **Embankments and cuttings** — visible in places along the old route
- **Bridge abutments** — stone supports where the line crossed roads and rivers
- **The Inch Wildfowl Reserve** — the walking trail follows the old railway embankment

There have been discussions about converting sections of the old railway into greenways, similar to successful projects elsewhere in Ireland, but for now most of the route remains in private hands.

## A Window Into the Past

A recently shared photograph from the 1950s shows a Lough Swilly train at Fahan Station — steam rising, passengers waiting, the road bridge still standing (and still in use today). Looking at that image, it's easy to imagine the bustle of a working railway station.

The photograph was shared on the Fahan, Inch & Burt Parish Facebook page, where locals regularly post historical images and memories of the railway era.

## Visiting Fahan

Fahan is worth a visit for more than just the Railway Tavern. The village has:

- **St. Mura's Cross** — a 7th-century carved stone cross at the site of an early Christian monastery
- **Lisfannon Beach** — one of Inishowen's most beautiful beaches, just north of the village
- **Fahan Marina** — modern sailing facilities on the shores of Lough Swilly
