A beautifully restored photograph has been circulating on local social media, bringing the colours of Fahan's past back to life. Taken roughly **120 years ago** — around 1904 — it captures a scene that would be unrecognisable to visitors today: sailing ships grounded on the tide, small rowing boats setting off across Lough Swilly, and the grand houses of wealthy Derry merchants lining the shore.

*"It's amazing to see the sailing ship grounded on the tide and the small rowing boat setting off,"* noted the post sharing the restored image. *"The landscape has changed, but the outline of the hills remains exactly the same."*

## A Working Waterfront

In the early 1900s, Fahan was a busy maritime community. The sheltered waters of Lough Swilly — one of only three glacial fjords in Ireland — made it an ideal location for fishing and cargo handling.

**Two-masted merchant schooners** would deliberately beach themselves at high tide along the shore. As the water retreated, carts would roll out across the sand to unload cargo: coal for heating, timber for building, flour for baking, and manure for the fields. It was hard, tide-dependent work that required precise timing and local knowledge.

Alongside the cargo vessels, **sailing trawlers** worked the waters of the lough, fishing for herring, mackerel, and whitefish. Fahan's fishermen knew every current and sandbank in Lough Swilly.

## The Age of Transition

The photograph captures a fascinating moment in maritime history — the transition from sail to steam and motor power.

In the 1890s and early 1900s, sailing vessels still dominated the waters around Inishowen. But change was coming. Steam trawlers were being introduced — powerful but expensive, requiring coal and skilled engineers. By the 1910s and 1920s, smaller motor engines would revolutionise fishing, giving boats the manoeuvrability and speed that sail could never match.

The grounded sailing ship in that old photograph represents a way of life that would largely disappear within a generation.

## Life in Edwardian Fahan

The early 1900s were a time of contrasts in Fahan. The grand houses visible in the restored photograph belonged to wealthy Derry merchants and professionals who had built summer residences along the scenic shores of Lough Swilly. Meanwhile, the working community — fishermen, farmers, labourers — lived in more modest cottages.

The **railway** had arrived in 1864, transforming Fahan from a remote coastal village into a stopping point on the Derry to Buncrana line. By the time this photograph was taken, Fahan Station was well established, and a ferry service connected the village to Rathmullan across the lough.

Everything ran to the rhythm of the tides. High water meant ships could beach and ferries could run. Low water meant waiting.

## Lough Swilly's Strategic Importance

Beyond fishing and cargo, Lough Swilly held strategic importance. During the First World War, it became a major naval base for the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet. Fortifications dating from the Napoleonic era were pressed back into service, and the lough's sheltered waters provided safe anchorage for warships.

The lough retained **Treaty Port** status until 1938, when Britain handed control to the Irish Free State — one of the last vestiges of British naval presence in independent Ireland.

## What Remains

Walk through Fahan today and you'll struggle to find traces of this maritime past. The cargo ships no longer beach on the shore. The fishing fleet has dwindled. The railway closed in 1953.

But some things endure:

- **The hills** — as the Facebook post noted, the landscape itself is unchanged
- **The Railway Tavern** — occupying the old station buildings
- **St. Mura's Cross** — the 7th-century carved stone that has watched over Fahan for 1,300 years
- **The grand houses** — many still standing, now private homes
- **Fahan Marina** — where leisure sailors have replaced the working boats

The population has changed too. In the early 1900s, around 800 people lived in Fahan. Today, the 2022 census recorded 589 residents.

## Connecting Past and Present

Photographs like this one — carefully restored and shared on community pages like *Fahan, Inch & Burt Parish* — serve as vital links to Inishowen's past. They remind us that the quiet villages we drive through today were once bustling with activity, that the empty shores once saw ships and commerce, and that the people who lived here shaped the landscape we now enjoy.

The outline of the hills remains exactly the same. Everything else has been transformed.
