Tourism Ireland definitely has good taste! 😎

There is no "prob-llama" that a walk at Wild Alpaca Way can't fix. It’s officially the best way to see the Inishowen coastline—mostly because the alpacas know all the best spots for a selfie. 🤳🦙

Come for the views, stay for the fluff. See you on the hills! ⛰️

## Instructions for Claude Code

This topic was discovered from a local Facebook page. When processing:

2. Research the topic using additional sources (Google, official sites, etc.)
3. If it's an event, find official event details
4. If it's news, find 2-3 additional sources covering the story
5. Write original content that adds value beyond the Facebook post
6. Link back to the Facebook page as one source among several
7. Save to /src/posts/ for news or /src/guides/ for evergreen content

IMPORTANT: Do NOT just rewrite the Facebook post. Use it as a starting point for proper research.

## Suggested approach

- "The [Page Name] Facebook page shared news about [topic]. Here's what we found..."
- Link to the Facebook post as one source
- Add context, background, and additional information from research
