⚓ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐭 𝐆𝐨𝐥𝐝 𝐨𝐟 𝐋𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐒𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐲 ⚓ 📅 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐒𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐲 – 𝟐𝟓𝐭𝐡 𝐉𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐚𝐫𝐲

On this day in 𝟏𝟗𝟏𝟕, one of Inishowen’s most dramatic maritime stories unfolded. Just as she cleared the mouth of 𝐋𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐒𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐲, the SS Laurentic met its tragic end.

Once a luxury liner, this wartime vessel struck two German mines and sank in less than an hour. While 354 lives were tragically lost in the icy waters, the ship took a massive secret to the seabed… 💰
