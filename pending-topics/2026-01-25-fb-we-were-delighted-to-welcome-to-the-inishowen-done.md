## Content

We were delighted to welcome to the Inishowen/Donegal stand at Holiday World Dublin, the new Turkish Ambassador to Ireland HE Esra Cankorur. We issued an invitation for her to visit Inishowen and hopefully she can visit later this year.

Don't forget to call to our stand if you are visiting the RDS in Dublin today or tomorrow 🙂
